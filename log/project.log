                 - -   <COMMIT REVISION 41>
[Thu 22 Feb 11:00am]	 Created Form and Page models, Forms controller, and migrations
[Thu 22 Feb 11:11am]	 Created Dashboard actions and view files.
[Thu 22 Feb 11:36am]	 Rearranged Routes, login/logout redirects, and dashboard urls
[Thu 22 Feb 11:59am]	*Suspecting that we might not need the Admins controller at all, just the model, and operate everything from the users and doctors controller?
                 - -   <COMMIT REVISION 42>
[Thu 22 Feb 12:25pm]	*Admins -- we might rather have a type field in the users table, specifying a 1 for Admin and 0 for DoctorUser,
-                   	 having each a sub-model, both inhereting from the Users model.
[Thu 22 Feb 14:17pm]	 Struggling with how to associate Notes with the different types of forms, which have different models.
[Thu 22 Feb 14:33pm]	 Created a POLYMORPHIC relationship between Notes and all the different form types!
-                      Notes has two association fields: form_id and form_type; and Forms has a type field
[Thu 22 Feb 15:29pm]	 Creating a HABTM relationship between Doctors and Forms
[Thu 22 Feb 16:49pm]	 Created Patients - controller, model with hefty migration
                 - -   <COMMIT REVISION 43>
[Thu 22 Feb 16:55pm]	 Ready to work on: patients/search, Notes create/read/update/destroy, Associating Doctors with Forms in the Doctor updating action,
-                      FormOperations module (managing notes, patient and logging information)
[Fri 23 Feb 09:09am]	*INDEXing is something we probably want to do for the Archived forms databases.
[Fri 23 Feb 10:01am]	 Recreated Notes via scaffold_resource, routes.db point to /:doctor_alias/forms/:form_type/notes/:action/:id
[Fri 23 Feb 14:06pm]	 Reworked relationships a bit: Notes belongs_to :form_instance, :polymorphic => true, :as => :form; BasicForm has_many :notes, :as => :form_instance
-                      Changed migrations (sorry I do this against convention so I don't pile up migrations...:S). The FormType model connects with the form_types table,
-                      which will have to be populated by migrations as we add each form_type.
[Fri 23 Feb 16:52pm]	*When patient information is changed, the system must ask the User on submitting the form whether to save the changes to the patient data or not.
[Fri 23 Feb 16:53pm]	 Working on Admins tying a Doctor to FormTypes.

                 - -   <COMMIT REVISION 45>
[Mon 26 Feb 13:25pm]	 Having trouble with the type field in the FormType model - found out I don't really need it to be named 'type' -
-                      I thought it was necessary for an association, but that must have been a while ago.
[Mon 26 Feb 14:24pm]	 Finished the correct associations, etc to associate Doctors with FormTypes, as well as implementing the drop-down input in the Edit form.
                 - -   <COMMIT REVISION 46>
[Mon 26 Feb 23:04pm]	Picked layout for pages, the front facing part of the site. Moved resources to public folder, started pages layout, put some content in db. I'm having trouble with routes though, they don't use the stub correctly, so I need Dan to fix it. Also, I need Dan to make a migration and change the body field from varchar to text so I can fit more than 255 characters in. Next I need to decide where to put my Admin section for the pages stuff, and then build in the dojo editor for ease of use... Also, should I have the menu's be easily editable from admin, or hardcoded into the template? cost/convenience?
