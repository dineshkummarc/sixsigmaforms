Login Accounts can only be created by an existing user who has ACL rights to create Login Accounts. (ACL Privileges: CreateEqualLoginAccounts, CreateChildLoginAccounts)


The Process:

(1)
  An administrator creates a user account, putting in certain details of the user, depending on what kind of user is being created. Required fields: EMAIL
  The user is emailed a User Registration Key, and a link to activate the user is provided to the administrator should they desire to activate by themselves.

[+] Required: email (+optional requirements)

(2)
  The user clicks on the link provided, fills out the registration form, including the username and password. User is now registered. Required fields: USERNAME, PASSWORD, PASSWORD_CONFIRMATION

[+] Required: email, username, password, password_confirmation(once) (+optional requirements)

Thus, [username, password] are required when registration key is not present, and [password_confirmation] is required on user create or password change.
