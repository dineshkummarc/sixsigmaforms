x when you logout of sixsigma admin it uses the wrong template
x fix the authentication bug (which will also fix the logout redirect problem)
x find and replace all @current_domain type variables to current_domain functions (in views), and remove initiate_global_vars
x create the Status class and functions.
x the discard and edit links on the Admin side need to be removed.
x Status counts are not right in the tabs!
x when you login to sixsigma admin it should take you to the forms section immediately
x Visual Identifier for the current draft - a title of sorts: Daniel Parker - March 14, 2007
x go over ALL controllers/actions and ensure ACL's work
x make the Login/Logout link in the upper-right hand corner be right-justified
x the path /sixsigma/forms should work without having the /status/submitted

- !!Submitting to SixSigma creates a new draft instead of submitting!!
- create the VIEW for Doctors for the SUBMITTED and ARCHIVED forms
- create the VIEW for ADMINS for Reviewing a form (accept&archive, return with note, etc)
- create the Admins Form workflow (submit -> review -> archived)
- create the Archived view: past 30, paginator, live search (controls to pull back)
- add the 'don't save changes to patient' checkbox (next to the expand/collapse link)
- Acts_as_deleted
- create Log viewer (per form): condense log entries to logical form progression benchmarck notations
- LOGGER: log which fields are updated on each update

- make the Login/Logout link in the upper-right hand corner be right-justified
- change cursor focus when you go to a page with a search field or form to fill out
- 'roll up' link for form sections, when expanded
- visual (arrow/triangle) for roll down/up links
- condense parts of the form(s): dropdown for sex, marital, work, location; datepicker for birthdates
   -- I'd like to never have to scroll in these forms, if possible, by collapsing and expanding sections.
   -- Can we have sub-sections expand/collapse?
- add visuals? icons?
- add "show all" link to live_search partial? (populates search box with 'all' and performs the search)
